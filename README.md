# Time Tracker
A fun project to track compressed work hours based on cycles

## Note
- Many code improvements to be made
- Want to make more abstraction and design the app better
- There are TODOs in the code, which are notes to myself for places I want to revisit

&nbsp; I also have a TODO where I set the datetime.now var back to a specific time for testing - need to remove this if you want the start time and date to match when the add regular work day button is clicked.


### Another note
- As (primarily) React developer, not sure if I like python UI code much... Who said that? ðŸ‘€
